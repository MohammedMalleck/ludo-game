# Overview 

This is a web based game. It focuses on improving my problem solving skills. Like many other games this game also uses state management to deal with finite states after a
particular action by the user. Also known as Pachisi , this game was invented in the Indain Subcontinent during the british rule.

## What can you do?

- Create issues for the cases that I might've missed.
- Frok the repository and create pull requests of refactored code.
###### You can view the state management file in the repo , to get a better idea of how i am dealing with different cases.

## Project Status

This is an ongoing project , so dont get confused if you see cases that arent still completed from state management or arent noted in state management itself.

## Note!

I do not encourage individuals playing the game and wasting much of their time which can be used in something productive. This game is being developed to expand my 
problem solving skills , not to create it for individuals who prefer to waste much of their time on a game based on luck. I highly recommend playing games that require more critical thinking and dont entirely depend upon luck.
